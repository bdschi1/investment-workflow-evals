## Executive Summary

### Thesis

NON-CONSENSUS VIEW: While consensus focuses on [consensus narrative], the combination of [factor 1] and [factor 2] creates [opportunity/risk] that [direction] [what the market is missing]. The market is [underestimating/overestimating] the [structural/cyclical] [headwind/tailwind] from [specific driver].

*Example: While consensus focuses on defensive rotation benefits, the combination of 94x trailing P/E distortion requiring normalization and elevated real rates at 2.8% creates unprecedented valuation compression risk that outweighs franchise quality.*

### Key Decision Factors

| # | Factor |
|---|--------|
| 1 | [Most important factor driving the recommendation -- quantify where possible] |
| 2 | [Second factor with specific data point or comparison to support the claim] |
| 3 | [Third factor, ideally addressing what consensus is missing] |
| 4 | [Fourth factor, addressing risk/reward asymmetry] |

### Evidence Weighed

| Bull Points Accepted | Bear Points Accepted |
|---------------------|---------------------|
| [Specific bull argument the committee found persuasive, with data] | [Specific bear argument accepted as valid, with data] |
| [Second bull point with evidence] | [Second bear point with evidence] |
| [Third bull point -- note these should be genuinely strong] | [Third bear point -- honest assessment of risks] |

## Investment Thesis (Bull Case)

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| **Bull Conviction** | {{BULL_CONVICTION}}/10 |
| **Time Horizon** | {{BULL_HORIZON}} |

### Core Thesis

[2-3 paragraph articulation of the investment thesis. Lead with the non-consensus insight. Explain why the market is mispricing this security and what will cause the gap to close.]

*Example: ABBV is executing a superior post-Humira transition with Skyrizi/Rinvoq generating sustainable competitive moats, while the market undervalues the company's operational leverage and margin expansion potential as higher-margin drugs scale.*

### Technical Outlook

[Brief technical context: current price relative to 52-week range, moving averages, volume patterns, analyst consensus targets. 1-2 sentences max.]

### Supporting Evidence

1. [First piece of evidence with specific numbers -- e.g., "Perfect earnings execution: 4/4 beats in 2025 with 3% average surprise rate"]
2. [Second piece of evidence with quantification]
3. [Third piece of evidence referencing competitive positioning]
4. [Fourth piece of evidence on financial metrics -- margins, growth, cash flow]
5. [Fifth piece of evidence on valuation or structural advantage]

## Bear Case / Risk Assessment

| | |
|---|---|
| **Risk Score** | {{RISK_SCORE}}/10 |
| **Recommendation** | {{BEAR_RECOMMENDATION}} |

### Active Short Thesis

> **[One-sentence short thesis -- strong, specific, actionable. Example: "ABBV trading at 94x trailing P/E on 6.9% margins is unsustainable financial engineering masking structural deterioration -- short target $160 on inevitable multiple compression."]**

### Primary Risks

1. [Growth deceleration risk -- where is revenue growth vulnerable?]
2. [Valuation risk -- what multiple compression looks like and why it happens]
3. [Regulatory/pricing risk -- government or industry pricing pressure]
4. [Balance sheet risk -- leverage, debt maturity, interest expense]
5. [Pipeline/execution risk -- what happens if key initiatives fail]

### Causal Chain Analysis

| Order | Effect |
|-------|--------|
| 2nd Order | If [trigger event] then [immediate consequence] because [mechanism] |
| 2nd Order | If [valuation trigger] then [price impact] because [mathematical relationship] |
| 2nd Order | If [regulatory trigger] then [margin impact] because [negotiation dynamics] |
| 2nd Order | If [cash flow trigger] then [coverage impact] because [debt load specifics] |
| 2nd Order | If [strategic trigger] then [valuation impact] because [growth imperative] |
| 3rd Order | If [2nd order effect] then [market amplification] leading to [cascade effect] |
| 3rd Order | If [2nd order pricing effect] then [margin compression magnitude] leading to [EBITDA destruction] |
| 3rd Order | If [2nd order coverage effect] then [credit rating impact] leading to [cost of capital increase] |
| 3rd Order | If [2nd order strategic effect] then [balance sheet stress] leading to [dividend/shareholder impact] |

### Worst Case Scenario

[Single paragraph describing the scenario where multiple bear risks materialize simultaneously. Include specific price targets, margin impacts, and probability-weighted downside. Be honest about how bad it could get.]

*Example: Skyrizi growth stalls at 15-20% vs 40% projected, triggering analyst downgrades and P/E compression from 94x to 20x (stock to $160). Simultaneously, Medicare pricing precedent cascades to private payers, compressing immunology margins by 400bps and destroying $5B EBITDA. Stock becomes a dividend value trap, falling to $120-140 representing 65% downside.*

| Debt / Leverage | [Debt-to-cash ratio, coverage ratios, refinancing risk] |
