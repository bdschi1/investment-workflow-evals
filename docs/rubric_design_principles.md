# Rubric Design Principles

## Overview

Effective evaluation rubrics for investment content must balance objectivity (verifiable criteria) with judgment (analytical quality). This document outlines principles for designing rubrics that produce consistent, meaningful assessments of AI-generated investment research.

## Core Design Principles

### 1. Operationalize Abstract Qualities

**Problem**: Terms like "rigorous analysis" or "clear thesis" are subjective.

**Solution**: Define concrete, verifiable criteria for each quality.

**Example - "Clear Investment Thesis"**:

❌ Poor: "Thesis is clearly stated"

✅ Good:
- Thesis statement appears in first paragraph (Yes/No)
- Thesis specifies direction (long/short/neutral) (Yes/No)
- Thesis includes time horizon (0-6mo / 6-12mo / 12-24mo) (Yes/No)
- Thesis identifies specific catalyst (Yes/No)
- Thesis states expected return range (Yes/No)

### 2. Use Graduated Scoring

Avoid binary pass/fail; use graduated scales that capture degrees of quality.

**Scale Options**:

**5-point scale** (detailed work):
- 5 = Exceptional (exceeds institutional standards)
- 4 = Strong (meets institutional standards)
- 3 = Adequate (acceptable with minor issues)
- 2 = Weak (significant gaps or errors)
- 1 = Poor (fundamental failures)
- 0 = Missing/not attempted

**3-point scale** (rapid assessment):
- 2 = Strong (clear pass)
- 1 = Marginal (borderline)
- 0 = Weak (clear fail)

### 3. Weight by Importance

Not all criteria are equally important. Assign weights reflecting real-world priorities.

**Example - Equity Thesis Rubric (100 points total)**:

| Dimension | Weight | Rationale |
|-----------|--------|-----------|
| Factual Accuracy | 30% | Wrong facts = useless analysis |
| Analytical Logic | 25% | Reasoning must be sound |
| Risk Assessment | 20% | Risk awareness is critical |
| Evidence Quality | 15% | Claims need support |
| Completeness | 10% | Should cover material factors |

### 4. Provide Anchor Examples

For each score level, provide concrete examples of what that performance looks like.

### 5. Separate "What" from "How"

Distinguish between content quality (factual accuracy, completeness) and presentation quality (clarity, formatting).
