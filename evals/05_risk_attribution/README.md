# Risk Attribution Module

This module evaluates AI-generated risk attribution and performance analysis, testing the ability to decompose returns into factor, environmental, and idiosyncratic components.

## Focus Areas

- **Factor Decomposition** - Correctly attributing returns to systematic factors vs alpha
- **Hypothesis Testing** - Evidence-based conclusions about skill vs luck
- **Contextual Evaluation** - Evaluating performance conditional on environment
- **Intentionality Assessment** - Distinguishing deliberate exposures from accidental bets

## Status

🚧 **Under Development** — Scenarios and rubrics coming soon.

## Planned Scenarios

- Alpha vs Environment Attribution
- Capital vs Risk Concentration

## Scoring Dimensions

1. **Attribution Discipline** (35%) - Factor decomposition, residual alpha calculation
2. **Hypothesis Testing** (35%) - Evidence-based conclusions, appropriate skepticism
3. **Contextual Evaluation** (30%) - Skill conditional on environment, intentionality

## Common AI Failure Modes

- Narrative attribution without factor analysis
- Declaring alpha failure without decomposition
- Ignoring environmental context in performance evaluation
- Confusing intentional positioning with accidental exposure
