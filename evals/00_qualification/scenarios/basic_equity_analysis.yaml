# === CONTEXT ===

context:
  company:
    name: "HomeStyle Brands"
    ticker: "HSB"
    sector: "Consumer Discretionary - Home Furnishings"
    market_cap: "$4.2B"
    description: >
      HomeStyle Brands is a mid-cap retailer specializing in home furnishings
      and decor, operating 380 stores across the United States with a growing
      e-commerce presence (~22% of sales).

  situation: >
    HomeStyle recently reported Q3 2024 earnings that beat consensus estimates.
    Revenue grew 8% YoY to $1.1B, with comparable store sales up 4.2%. However,
    gross margins compressed 120bps to 38.1% due to higher freight costs and
    promotional activity. Management raised full-year revenue guidance but
    maintained EBITDA guidance, implying continued margin pressure in Q4.

    The stock is down 12% YTD despite the earnings beat, trading at 11x forward
    earnings vs. the 5-year average of 14x. Bulls point to the valuation gap
    and improving top-line trends. Bears worry about margin sustainability
    and consumer spending headwinds.

  market_conditions: >
    Consumer discretionary sector facing headwinds from higher interest rates
    impacting home purchases and renovation activity. Home furnishing peers
    have seen mixed results, with some reporting inventory build-up. Housing
    turnover at multi-year lows, though existing home improvement spending
    remains relatively stable.
