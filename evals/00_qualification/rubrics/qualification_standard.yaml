        label: "Excellent"
        description: >
          Thesis is immediately clear, specific to the company, and demonstrates
          insight beyond surface-level analysis. Reasoning chain is tight and
          professional-quality.

        label: "Good"

      - score_range: [60, 74]
        label: "Acceptable"
