context: |
  You have received a full investment committee memo analyzing a pharmaceutical
  company (ABBV - AbbVie Inc). The memo includes an underweight recommendation
  with conviction 4.2/10 from the portfolio manager, a bull case at 7.8/10
  conviction highlighting the Skyrizi/Rinvoq franchise, and a bear case at
  8.2/10 risk severity citing 94x trailing P/E and $69B in debt. The macro
  environment is rated 6.5/10 favorable.

  Your task is to translate this into a blog post that a retail investor with
  no finance degree could understand and act on.

  2. Explain what the company does and why it matters
  3. Highlight 3-5 key numbers with plain English annotations
  4. List risks as "what could go wrong" in simple terms
  5. End with a clear "bottom line" action statement

  Do NOT include: financial jargon without definitions, multi-level bullet
  hierarchies, tables with more than 4 columns, or disclaimers.
