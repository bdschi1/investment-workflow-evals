# AbbVie (ABBV) -- Should You Consider This Stock?

**The short version:** AbbVie is a large pharmaceutical company that professional analysts are cautious about right now. While the company has strong new drugs, concerns about its high debt and an unusually expensive stock price led the investment committee to recommend keeping a smaller-than-normal position. The average analyst price target is around $245 per share, but internal analysis flags meaningful risks.

## What Does AbbVie Do?

AbbVie makes medicines that treat serious conditions like arthritis, cancer, and skin diseases. Their biggest product, Humira, was once the best-selling drug in the world. Now that cheaper generic versions (called biosimilars) are available from competitors, AbbVie has been working hard to replace that lost revenue with two newer drugs: Skyrizi and Rinvoq. So far, the transition is going better than expected -- these new drugs are growing fast and gaining market share.

## Why Some Analysts Like It

- AbbVie has beaten Wall Street's earnings estimates every single quarter recently, typically by about 3% -- a sign that management sets conservative expectations.
- The company brings in about $61 billion in annual revenue and is growing at roughly 10% per year.
- Skyrizi and Rinvoq are proving durable against competitors in the immunology market and could keep driving growth for years.
- The stock trades at about 14 times next year's expected earnings, which is cheaper than many similar drug companies.

## The Key Numbers

- **Revenue: about $61 billion** -- That is how much AbbVie sells each year across all its drugs.
- **Growth Rate: 10%** -- The company is growing at a healthy pace despite losing Humira sales.
- **Analyst Price Target: $245** -- Wall Street analysts on average think the stock could be worth $245, roughly 10% above the recent price near $223.
- **Operating Profit Margin: 35%** -- AbbVie keeps 35 cents of profit from every dollar of sales after operating costs.
- **Debt: $69 billion vs $5.7 billion cash** -- The company carries a heavy debt load, about 12 times its cash on hand.

## What Could Go Wrong

- Cheaper Humira copies keep eating into AbbVie's legacy revenue, and the pace could accelerate.
- If Skyrizi's growth slows below 25% per year, the whole investment story breaks down.
- The $69 billion debt pile means AbbVie needs nearly perfect execution -- a bad quarter could raise questions about whether the dividend is safe.
- Government drug pricing rules (Medicare negotiations) could expand, squeezing profit margins across AbbVie's drug lineup.
- The stock's trailing price-to-earnings ratio of 94x looks inflated due to accounting quirks and must come down, which could pressure the share price.

## Bottom Line

AbbVie is a company in transition with real strengths -- especially its newer drugs -- but also real risks from heavy debt and a stock price that may already reflect the good news. The professional investment committee rated this a cautious "underweight," meaning they suggest holding less than you normally would. If you already own AbbVie, there is no urgency to sell, but this may not be the best time to add more. Consider watching for a pullback or clearer signs that the new drugs can fully replace Humira before increasing your position.
