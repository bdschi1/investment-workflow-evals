# Biotech Phase 3 Catalyst Scenario
# Tests: Event-driven analysis, probability estimation, binary outcome assessment

title: "Biotech Phase 3 Readout - Event-Driven Thesis"
version: "1.0.0"
module: "01_equity_thesis"
category: "event_driven"
difficulty: "moderate"
estimated_time_minutes: 45

context:
  company:
    name: "Vertex Therapeutics"
    ticker: "VRTX"
    sector: "Healthcare - Biotechnology"
    market_cap: "$95B"
    description: >
      Vertex is a global biotechnology company focused on developing
      transformative medicines for serious diseases. The company has a
      dominant franchise in cystic fibrosis (CF) treatments and is
      diversifying into pain, kidney disease, and gene editing.

  situation: >
    Vertex has a Phase 3 readout expected in Q1 2025 for VX-548, a
    non-opioid pain medication targeting acute pain. The drug showed
    mixed results in Phase 2, meeting primary endpoints in some studies
    but narrowly missing in others. The acute pain market represents a
    $10B+ opportunity if the drug succeeds and gains broad adoption.

    The stock has rallied 25% over the past 3 months on optimism about
    the pipeline, and options markets imply a 15% move on the readout.

    Key uncertainties include:
    - Primary endpoint success (pain reduction vs placebo)
    - Safety profile (GI side effects observed in Phase 2)
    - Differentiation vs existing non-opioid options
    - Regulatory pathway (NDA vs additional trials)

  market_conditions: >
    Biotech sector has underperformed broader market YTD. M&A activity
    remains elevated with large pharma seeking pipeline replenishment.
    Opioid crisis has created regulatory tailwinds for non-opioid
    alternatives, but commercial success of prior entrants has been
    disappointing (e.g., Nektar's NKTR-181 failure).

  as_of_date: "2024-12-15"

  additional_context: >
    Vertex's CF franchise generates $8B+ annually with high margins.
    The company has $13B in cash and no debt. Management has historically
    been conservative in guidance but has recently increased commentary
    on VX-548's commercial potential. Several sell-side analysts have
    raised price targets citing option value from the pain program.

task:
  prompt: >
    Develop an investment thesis for Vertex Therapeutics (VRTX) ahead of
    the VX-548 Phase 3 readout. Your analysis should include:

    1. A clear long/short recommendation with position sizing
    2. Assessment of the probability of Phase 3 success
    3. Scenario analysis for success vs failure outcomes
    4. Risk/reward framework with specific price targets
    5. Key risks and mitigants
    6. Catalysts and timing considerations

    Base your analysis on the provided context and publicly available
    information as of December 2024.
