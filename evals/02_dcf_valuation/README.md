# DCF Valuation Module

This module evaluates AI-generated DCF valuations and valuation frameworks, testing the ability to construct logically consistent models that appropriately reflect uncertainty.

## Focus Areas

- **Alpha vs Environment Separation** - Distinguishing company-specific value creation from environmental tailwinds
- **Risk Treatment** - Reflecting uncertainty through assumptions rather than narrative smoothing
- **Terminal Value Discipline** - Preventing perpetuity assumptions from embedding unhedged risks
- **Cyclical vs Structural Analysis** - Separating mean reversion from true operational improvement

## Scenarios

### Life Sciences Tools: Alpha vs Environment
Tests ability to value a company that benefited from extraordinary funding tailwinds, distinguishing sustainable competitive advantage from temporary environmental demand.

**Key Challenge:** Avoiding capitalization of biotech funding cycles as permanent alpha.

### MedTech: Normalization Is Not Risk-Neutral
Tests ability to value a company emerging from a downturn where management claims structural margin improvement.

**Key Challenge:** Distinguishing cyclical recovery from true operational alpha, and reflecting uncertainty appropriately.

## Common AI Failure Modes

- Treating diversification as immunity to environmental cycles
- Embedding funding-cycle tailwinds into terminal value
- Converting historical margins into automatic destiny
- Narrative smoothing of uncertainty
- Assuming management claims without verification framework

## Scoring Dimensions

1. **Alpha vs Environment / Cyclical vs Structural** (35%)
2. **Risk Treatment** (35%)
3. **Terminal Value Discipline / Uncertainty Handling** (30%)

## Critical Failures

- Misclassifying environmental risk as alpha
- Implicitly hedging nothing while assuming full recovery
- Embedding unhedged sector-wide growth into perpetuity
