# === CONTEXT ===

context:
  company:
    name: "Surgical Dynamics Corp"
    ticker: "SDC"
    sector: "Healthcare - Medical Devices"
    market_cap: "$12B"
    description: >
      MedTech company focused on elective surgical procedures including
      orthopedic implants, spine surgery devices, and surgical robotics.
      Revenue is highly correlated with hospital procedure volumes.

  situation: >
    The company is emerging from a significant downturn caused by elective
    procedure deferrals. Margins are well below historical averages due to
    volume deleverage and labor inefficiencies. Management claims structural
    improvements will support higher margins going forward, citing:
    - Automation investments in manufacturing
    - Shift to higher-margin robotic-assisted procedures
    - Rationalized SKU portfolio
    - Improved sales force productivity

    However, current utilization at customer hospitals remains 15% below
    pre-pandemic levels, and staffing shortages continue to constrain
    procedure capacity.

  market_conditions: >
    Elective procedure volumes recovering unevenly. Orthopedic procedures
    at ~90% of pre-pandemic levels. Hospital staffing shortages persist.
    Wage inflation elevated in healthcare. Competitors also claiming
    structural margin improvements.

# === TASK ===

task:
  prompt: >
    A medtech company focused on elective procedures is emerging from a downturn.
    Margins are well below historical averages due to volume deferrals and labor
    inefficiencies. Management claims structural improvements will support higher
    margins going forward.

    Explain how a valuation framework should distinguish cyclical mean reversion
    from true structural improvement, and where uncertainty should be reflected.

    Your response should address:
    1. How to separate utilization recovery from operational improvement
    2. Where to allocate uncertainty (forecasts, terminal assumptions, or discounting)
    3. How to treat normalization as a probabilistic outcome, not a base-case fact
    4. What evidence would distinguish cyclical recovery from structural improvement

  expected_output_type: "valuation_framework"

  constraints:
    - "Must separate cyclical vs structural drivers"
    - "Must not embed certainty into normalized margins"
    - "Must treat normalization as probabilistic"
    - "Must specify where uncertainty is reflected"

# === EVALUATION CRITERIA ===

evaluation_criteria:
  dimensions:
    - name: "Cyclical vs Structural Identification"
      id: "cyclical_structural"
      weight: 35
      criteria:
        - "Separates utilization recovery from operational improvement"
        - "Identifies which margin drivers are volume-dependent"
        - "Distinguishes temporary labor dynamics from permanent changes"
        - "Recognizes that competitors claim similar structural improvements"

    - name: "Risk Placement"
      id: "risk_placement"
      weight: 35
      criteria:
        - "Appropriately allocates uncertainty to forecasts, terminal assumptions, or discounting"
        - "Avoids embedding certainty into normalized margins"
        - "Does not treat historical margins as automatic destiny"
        - "Specifies mechanism for reflecting uncertainty"

    - name: "Judgment Under Uncertainty"
      id: "uncertainty_judgment"
      weight: 30
      criteria:
        - "Treats normalization as probabilistic outcome"
        - "Does not convert management claims into base-case facts"
        - "Identifies what evidence would validate structural improvement"
        - "Maintains intellectual honesty about unknowns"

  critical_failures:
    - "Implicitly hedged nothing while assuming full margin recovery"
    - "Converted historical margins into automatic destiny"
    - "Treated management claims as facts without verification framework"
    - "Assumed normalization without any risk compensation"

  pass_threshold: 70

# === PITFALLS ===

pitfalls:
  - description: "Assuming full margin normalization without uncertainty"
    failure_type: "false_certainty"
    severity: "critical"

  - description: "Treating historical peak margins as achievable floor"
    failure_type: "anchoring_bias"
    severity: "major"

  - description: "Ignoring that competitors claim identical improvements"
    failure_type: "insufficient_skepticism"
    severity: "major"

  - description: "Conflating volume recovery with operational alpha"
    failure_type: "cyclical_structural_confusion"
    severity: "major"

# === ADVERSARIAL VARIANT ===

adversarial_example:
  response: >
    Given historical margins and management's automation initiatives, it is
    reasonable to assume full margin normalization over the next several years,
    with the DCF capturing this through a return to prior peak margins.

  why_this_fails:
    - "Converts history into destiny"
    - "Ignores uncertainty in utilization recovery"
    - "Assumes normalization without risk compensation"
    - "Treats management initiatives as accomplished facts"
