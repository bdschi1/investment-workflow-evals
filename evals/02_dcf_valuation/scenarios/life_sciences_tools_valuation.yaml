# === CONTEXT ===

context:
  company:
    name: "Precision Life Sciences"
    ticker: "PLS"
    sector: "Healthcare - Life Sciences Tools & Services"
    market_cap: "$45B"
    description: >
      Diversified life sciences tools company with exposure to biopharma R&D,
      academic research, and diagnostics. Provides instrumentation, consumables,
      and software for life sciences research and clinical applications.

  situation: >
    Revenue growth accelerated during a period of elevated biotech funding and
    pandemic-era demand, but is now decelerating as funding tightens. The company
    benefited from unprecedented NIH budget increases, record biotech IPO/VC funding,
    and COVID-related research demand from 2020-2022.

    Consumables represent ~45% of revenue with recurring characteristics.
    Margins are expanding but remain below best-in-class peers (current EBITDA
    margin 22% vs peer average 28%). Management attributes margin gap to
    integration costs from recent acquisitions and investment in commercial
    infrastructure.

  market_conditions: >
    Biotech funding environment has normalized sharply. VC funding down 50%+ from
    peak. Biotech IPO market largely closed. NIH budget growth returning to
    historical ~3% annual increases after exceptional COVID-era expansion.
    Academic research budgets under pressure globally. Biopharma R&D spending
    growth moderating as large pharma faces patent cliffs.

# === TASK ===

task:
  prompt: >
    You are valuing Precision Life Sciences, a diversified life sciences tools
    company with exposure to biopharma R&D, academic research, and diagnostics.

    Revenue growth accelerated during a period of elevated biotech funding and
    pandemic-era demand, but is now decelerating as funding tightens. Consumables
    represent ~45% of revenue. Margins are expanding but remain below best-in-class peers.

    Construct a valuation logic that clearly distinguishes company-specific value
    creation from environmental tailwinds, and explain how this distinction should
    affect long-term growth, reinvestment, and terminal value assumptions.

    Your response should address:
    1. How to separate alpha (firm-controlled value creation) from environment (external tailwinds)
    2. How environmental uncertainty should be reflected in assumptions
    3. How to prevent terminal value from embedding unhedged sector-wide growth
    4. Specific guidance on growth, reinvestment, and ROIC assumptions

  expected_output_type: "valuation_framework"

  constraints:
    - "Must explicitly distinguish alpha vs environment drivers"
    - "Must not capitalize funding-cycle tailwinds as permanent alpha"
    - "Terminal value must not embed unhedged sector-wide growth"
    - "Must maintain internal consistency between growth, reinvestment, and margins"

# === EVALUATION CRITERIA ===

evaluation_criteria:
  dimensions:
    - name: "Alpha vs Environment Separation"
      id: "alpha_environment"
      weight: 35
      criteria:
        - "Correctly identifies which growth drivers are firm-controlled vs externally driven"
        - "Avoids capitalizing funding-cycle tailwinds as permanent alpha"
        - "Distinguishes installed base dynamics from funding-dependent demand"
        - "Recognizes that diversification does not eliminate environmental exposure"

    - name: "Risk Treatment in Valuation"
      id: "risk_treatment"
      weight: 35
      criteria:
        - "Reflects environmental uncertainty through assumptions, not narrative smoothing"
        - "Maintains internal consistency between growth, reinvestment, and margins"
        - "Does not use diversification as proxy for immunity to funding cycles"
        - "Appropriately discounts or probability-weights environmental scenarios"

    - name: "Terminal Value Discipline"
      id: "terminal_value"
      weight: 30
      criteria:
        - "Prevents terminal value from embedding unhedged sector-wide growth"
        - "Aligns terminal assumptions with long-run research funding realities"
        - "Does not extrapolate above-market growth into perpetuity"
        - "Terminal growth rate reflects sustainable, hedged assumptions"

  critical_failures:
    - "Misclassified environmental risk as alpha (treating biotech funding cycles as firm-level growth durability)"
    - "Embedded unhedged funding risk into terminal value"
    - "Used diversification as justification for premium terminal growth"
    - "Assumed full margin normalization without risk compensation"

  pass_threshold: 70

# === PITFALLS ===

pitfalls:
  - description: "Treating diversified customer base as immunity to funding cycles"
    failure_type: "alpha_environment_confusion"
    severity: "critical"

  - description: "Using installed base as justification for above-market terminal growth"
    failure_type: "terminal_value_inflation"
    severity: "critical"

  - description: "Narrative smoothing of environmental uncertainty"
    failure_type: "risk_misrepresentation"
    severity: "major"

  - description: "Extrapolating 2020-2022 growth rates as sustainable"
    failure_type: "recency_bias"
    severity: "major"

# === ADVERSARIAL VARIANT ===

adversarial_example:
  response: >
    Given the company's diversified customer base and strong consumables mix,
    recent growth demonstrates durable competitive advantage. While funding
    cycles fluctuate, the installed base ensures sustained above-market growth,
    justifying a premium terminal growth rate relative to GDP.

  why_this_fails:
    - "Treats environmental demand as structural alpha"
    - "Uses diversification as a proxy for immunity"
    - "Embeds unhedged funding risk into terminal value"
    - "Conflates installed base with funding-independent demand"
