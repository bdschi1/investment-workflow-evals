# === DIMENSIONS ===

dimensions:
  - name: "Alpha vs Environment Separation"
    id: "alpha_environment"
    weight: 35
    description: >
      Evaluates ability to distinguish company-specific value creation
      from environmental tailwinds and external demand drivers.

    scoring_levels:
      - score: "32-35"
        label: "Excellent"
        description: >
          Clearly identifies and separates firm-controlled drivers from
          environmental factors. Does not capitalize cyclical tailwinds
          as permanent alpha. Recognizes that diversification does not
          eliminate environmental exposure.
        anchor_examples:
          - "Explicitly separates biotech funding-driven demand from installed base growth"
          - "Quantifies environmental contribution vs organic market share gains"
          - "Notes that all competitors benefited from same tailwinds"

      - score: "25-31"
        label: "Good"
        description: >
          Identifies key alpha vs environment distinction. May miss some
          nuances but correctly avoids major conflation errors.
        anchor_examples:
          - "Recognizes funding cycle impact but doesn't fully quantify"
          - "Separates cyclical from structural but with some gaps"

      - score: "18-24"
        label: "Acceptable"
        description: >
          Shows awareness of distinction but treatment is superficial.
          May hedge without clear framework.
        anchor_examples:
          - "Mentions external factors but doesn't adjust assumptions"
          - "Acknowledges tailwinds without changing terminal value"

      - score: "10-17"
        label: "Poor"
        description: >
          Minimal distinction between alpha and environment.
          Treats recent performance as indicative of durable advantage.

      - score: "0-9"
        label: "Fail"
        description: >
          Conflates environmental tailwinds with company-specific alpha.
          Capitalizes cyclical demand into perpetuity.

  - name: "Risk Treatment in Valuation"
    id: "risk_treatment"
    weight: 35
    description: >
      Evaluates whether uncertainty is reflected through assumptions
      rather than narrative smoothing, with internal consistency.

    scoring_levels:
      - score: "32-35"
        label: "Excellent"
        description: >
          Reflects uncertainty through explicit assumptions, scenarios,
          or probability weighting. Maintains internal consistency between
          growth, reinvestment, and margins. Does not use diversification
          as proxy for immunity.
        anchor_examples:
          - "Uses scenario analysis with probability weights"
          - "Adjusts discount rate or growth for environmental uncertainty"
          - "Shows how margin assumptions tie to reinvestment needs"

      - score: "25-31"
        label: "Good"
        description: >
          Appropriate risk treatment with minor gaps. Consistency
          mostly maintained. Clear about where uncertainty lies.

      - score: "18-24"
        label: "Acceptable"
        description: >
          Some risk acknowledgment but treatment is narrative rather
          than quantitative. May have minor consistency issues.

      - score: "10-17"
        label: "Poor"
        description: >
          Narrative smoothing of uncertainty. Inconsistent assumptions.
          Risk acknowledged but not reflected in numbers.

      - score: "0-9"
        label: "Fail"
        description: >
          No meaningful risk treatment. Certainty embedded in assumptions.
          Internally inconsistent growth/margin/reinvestment.

  - name: "Terminal Value Discipline"
    id: "terminal_value"
    weight: 30
    description: >
      Evaluates whether terminal value avoids embedding unhedged
      sector-wide growth and aligns with long-run realities.

    scoring_levels:
      - score: "27-30"
        label: "Excellent"
        description: >
          Terminal growth rate reflects sustainable, hedged assumptions.
          Does not extrapolate above-market growth into perpetuity.
          Aligns with long-run funding/demand realities.
        anchor_examples:
          - "Terminal growth at or below GDP despite recent outperformance"
          - "Explicitly addresses why terminal margins are sustainable"
          - "Considers terminal ROIC convergence to cost of capital"

      - score: "21-26"
        label: "Good"
        description: >
          Reasonable terminal assumptions with minor issues.
          Avoids major perpetuity inflation errors.

      - score: "15-20"
        label: "Acceptable"
        description: >
          Terminal value somewhat elevated but not egregious.
          Limited justification for assumptions.

      - score: "8-14"
        label: "Poor"
        description: >
          Terminal value embeds optimistic assumptions without hedging.
          Above-market growth into perpetuity.

      - score: "0-7"
        label: "Fail"
        description: >
          Terminal value captures majority of enterprise value with
          unhedged assumptions. Perpetuates recent growth indefinitely.

# === CALIBRATION EXAMPLES ===

calibration_examples:
  - score: 92
    summary: >
      Clearly separates funding-driven demand from organic growth. Uses
      scenario-weighted terminal value. Explicitly addresses why terminal
      growth should be at GDP despite recent outperformance. Internally
      consistent assumptions.

  - score: 78
    summary: >
      Good alpha/environment distinction. Terminal value reasonable but
      not fully justified. Risk treatment adequate but mostly narrative.
      Minor consistency gaps.

  - score: 62
    summary: >
      Acknowledges external factors but doesn't adjust assumptions.
      Terminal growth slightly elevated. Mentions uncertainty but
      doesn't quantify or scenario-weight.

  - score: 45
    summary: >
      Conflates recent performance with durable advantage. Terminal
      value embeds above-market growth. Diversification cited as
      protection from cycles.
