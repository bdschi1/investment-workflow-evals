# Tests ability to challenge embedded WACC/discount rate in early-stage biotech DCF

title: "Biotech Discount Rate Assumption Challenge"
module: "04_assumption_validation"
difficulty: hard

context: |
  You are reviewing a sell-side analyst's DCF model for BioGenesis Therapeutics,
  a pre-revenue biotech company with two Phase 2 candidates and one Phase 3
  candidate in rare diseases.

  Key model assumptions embedded by the analyst:
  - WACC: 10.5% (derived from CAPM with beta of 1.2)
  - Risk-free rate: 4.3% (10-year Treasury)
  - Equity risk premium: 5.5%
  - Terminal growth rate: 3.0%
  - Revenue onset: 2027E (Phase 3 drug only)
  - Peak revenue: $2.8B by 2032E
  - R&D as % of revenue: 35% declining to 18% by 2032E
  - Cash runway: 14 months at current burn rate ($180M/quarter)
  - Probability of approval (PoA): Not explicitly stated; full revenue in base case

  Comparable companies:
  - Large-cap biotech peers trade at 8-12x EV/Revenue
  - Pre-revenue rare disease biotechs typically use 12-18% discount rates
  - Recent biotech IPOs priced at $400-600M enterprise value

  Additional context:
  - FDA has issued a Refuse-to-File letter for the Phase 3 candidate once
    before (2024); resubmission accepted January 2026
  - Management guided to "partnership discussions" for ex-US rights
  - Insider selling: CFO sold 40% of holdings in Q4 2025

task: |
  Review the discount rate and key assumptions embedded in this biotech DCF model.
  Identify which assumptions are reasonable, which are questionable, and which are
  critical red flags. For each questionable assumption, provide:
  1. Why it may be inappropriate
  2. What a more defensible assumption would be
  3. How sensitive the valuation is to this assumption

adversarial_example:
  response: |
    The WACC of 10.5% appears reasonable for a biotech company. The beta of 1.2
    is in line with the healthcare sector average. The terminal growth rate of 3%
    is conservative and below GDP growth. The revenue projections look achievable
    given the large addressable market in rare diseases. I would keep these
    assumptions as they are well-supported by the analyst's work.
  why_wrong: |
    - 10.5% WACC is dramatically too low for a pre-revenue biotech; peers use 12-18%
    - Beta of 1.2 is a large-cap biotech beta, not a clinical-stage company beta
    - Revenue projections embed 100% PoA (no probability adjustment)
    - 14-month cash runway creates dilution risk not reflected in WACC
    - RTF letter history and insider selling are ignored
    - Terminal growth at 3% on a drug portfolio with patent cliffs is unrealistic
