# Tests ability to challenge embedded commodity price forecasts in an E&P model

title: "Commodity Price Forecast Assumption Challenge"
module: "04_assumption_validation"
difficulty: hard

context: |
  You are reviewing a junior analyst's financial model for Permian Resources Corp,
  a mid-cap E&P company focused on the Permian Basin.

  Key commodity assumptions embedded:
  - WTI crude: $85/bbl through forecast period (2026E-2030E)
  - Natural gas (Henry Hub): $4.50/MMBtu through forecast period
  - NGL realization: 35% of WTI
  - Basis differential: -$2.50/bbl (Midland-Cushing spread)

  Model-derived metrics at these prices:
  - EBITDA margin: 62% stable throughout
  - FCF yield: 14% in 2026E, rising to 18% by 2030E
  - Net debt/EBITDA: 0.8x declining to 0.2x
  - Breakeven: $42/bbl WTI (including capex for maintenance production)

  Current market context:
  - WTI spot: $78/bbl (as of review date)
  - Forward curve: $74/bbl (12-month), $68/bbl (24-month), $65/bbl (36-month)
  - OPEC+ maintaining production cuts; compliance slipping
  - US production at record 13.4 MMbbl/d
  - Natural gas: spot $3.20/MMBtu, 12-month forward $3.80/MMBtu
  - LNG export capacity additions expected 2026-2027

  Hedge book:
  - 60% of 2026E oil production hedged at $76/bbl (costless collars: $72-$84)
  - 0% of natural gas hedged
  - No hedges beyond 2026

task: |
  Critically evaluate the commodity price assumptions embedded in this E&P model.
  For each assumption:
  1. Compare to current spot, forward curve, and historical ranges
  2. Assess whether the assumption is reasonable, aggressive, or conservative
  3. Quantify the impact on key metrics (EBITDA, FCF, leverage) at alternative prices
  4. Identify which assumptions create the greatest valuation risk

adversarial_example:
  response: |
    The commodity price assumptions are reasonable. WTI at $85 reflects the current
    geopolitical environment and OPEC+ support. Natural gas at $4.50 accounts for
    growing LNG demand. These prices are well within the 5-year historical range.
    The model looks conservative given the strong hedge book protecting downside.
  why_wrong: |
    - $85 WTI is $7 above spot and $17-20 above the 2-3 year forward curve
    - Natural gas at $4.50 is 40% above spot and 18% above the 12-month forward
    - "Well within historical range" ignores that the forward curve prices in supply/demand
    - Hedge book only covers 60% of oil for 1 year; model uses $85 for 5 years
    - No sensitivity analysis provided
    - OPEC+ compliance slipping and record US production are bearish signals ignored
    - Using flat commodity deck instead of forward curve inflates terminal value
