    summary: >
      Extracts all explicit and implicit assumptions (including hidden 100% PoA).
      Benchmarks WACC against pre-revenue biotech peers (12-18%).  Quantifies NPV
      sensitivity to WACC (45% drop at 15%) and PoA (50% drop at 60%).  Identifies
      cash runway / dilution as structural flaw.  Proposes specific alternatives
      with peer-based justification.

  - score: 76
    summary: >
      Good extraction of major assumptions.  Correctly flags WACC as too low
      and PoA as missing.  Limited quantification of sensitivity.  Proposes
      some alternatives but not all are well-justified.

  - score: 58
    summary: >
      Identifies WACC and commodity price as questionable but treatment is
      superficial.  No sensitivity quantification.  Misses implicit PoA
      assumption.  Directional comments only.

  - score: 35
    summary: >
      Accepts most assumptions.  Notes WACC "might be low" without benchmarks.
      No red flags identified.  No alternatives proposed.
