title: "Capital vs. Risk: The High-Vol Trap"
context:
  portfolio:
    position_A: "10% weight in Mega-Cap Pharma (15% Vol)"
    position_B: "4% weight in Small-Cap Biotech (60% Vol)"
  pm_belief: "Position A is more than twice as risky as Position B because it has more than double the capital."
task: "Evaluate the PM's risk assessment. Which position contributes more to portfolio volatility?"
anchor_answers:
  strong:
    response: |
      The PM's assessment is incorrect. Risk contribution is a function of weight * volatility. 
      Position A (0.10 * 0.15) = 1.5% vol contribution units. 
      Position B (0.04 * 0.60) = 2.4% vol contribution units. 
      Despite having less than half the capital, the Biotech position is significantly 'larger' 
      in risk terms. Per Paleologo’s 'Advanced Portfolio Management', sizing should be 
      vol-normalized to ensure the tail doesn't wag the dog.

    response: |
      The PM is correct. By concentrating capital in the 10% Pharma position, the portfolio's 
      main performance driver is the Mega-Cap leg. The 4% Biotech position is a smaller, 
      speculative side-bet that is appropriately sized to limit total loss potential.
