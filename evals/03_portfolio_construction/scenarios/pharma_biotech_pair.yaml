      name: "MegaPharma Inc"
      ticker: "MEGA"
      market_cap: "$180B"
      characteristics:
        - "Large-cap diversified pharma"
        - "Stable cash flows from mature franchises"

        - "Beta: 0.7"

      characteristics:
        - "Mid-cap biotech"

      thesis: "Pipeline probability of success overpriced; management history of overpromising"

  portfolio_context:
    strategy: "Long/short healthcare"
    gross_exposure: "150%"
    net_exposure: "30%"
    existing_healthcare_weight: "25% of gross"

  market_conditions: >
    XBI (biotech ETF) down 15% YTD. Large pharma outperforming on defensive flows.
    Rising rates environment favoring cash-generative over cash-burning names.
    Sector correlation elevated during recent volatility.

# === TASK ===

task:
  prompt: >
    You construct a long/short healthcare pair: long a large-cap pharma company
    with stable cash flows; short a mid-cap biotech trading on pipeline optionality.
    The thesis is stock-specific.

    Explain how you would hedge environmental risks while preserving intended
    idiosyncratic exposure, and how sizing should reflect this distinction.

    Your response should address:
    1. Classification of risks as market, factor, environmental, or idiosyncratic
    2. What should be hedged and what should not
    3. Sizing methodology that reflects risk contribution, not notional capital
    4. How to avoid over-hedging away alpha

  expected_output_type: "portfolio_construction_framework"

  constraints:
    - "Must classify risks correctly"
    - "Must hedge environmental risks, not alpha"
    - "Must use risk-based sizing, not dollar-based"
    - "Must explain rationale for what is and is not hedged"

      criteria:
        - "Correctly identifies market, factor, and duration risks as environmental"
        - "Identifies pipeline outcomes as idiosyncratic"

      weight: 30
      criteria:

        - "Accounts for asymmetric volatility between legs"
        - "Considers nonlinear biotech risk (binary outcomes)"
        - "Reflects intended alpha expression in sizing"

    - "Claims neutrality while leaving major environmental risk unhedged"
    - "Sizes positions equally on dollar basis without risk adjustment"
    - "Confuses notional symmetry with risk neutrality"
    - "Ignores volatility differential between legs"

# === PITFALLS ===

pitfalls:
  - description: "Dollar-neutral sizing ignoring volatility differential"
    failure_type: "sizing_error"
    severity: "critical"

  - description: "Claiming beta neutrality without adjustment for sector exposure"
    failure_type: "false_neutrality"
    severity: "major"

  - description: "Over-hedging idiosyncratic exposure that is the thesis"

  - description: "Ignoring binary nature of biotech pipeline outcomes"
    failure_type: "risk_mischaracterization"
    severity: "major"

# === ADVERSARIAL VARIANT ===

adversarial_example:
  response: >
    By sizing the positions equally on a dollar basis, the trade achieves
    neutrality while allowing valuation convergence to drive returns.

  why_this_fails:
    - "Confuses notional symmetry with risk neutrality"
    - "Ignores volatility differential (18% vs 55%)"
    - "Ignores nonlinear biotech risk"
    - "Leaves environment unhedged"
