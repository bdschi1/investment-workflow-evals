title: "Notional vs. Risk-Based Sizing"
observed_relationship: |
  A PM has 10% in a 12% vol Large-Cap Pharma stock and 5% in a 60% vol 
  Biotech stock. They claim the Pharma stock is the "primary risk driver."
context: |
  Risk-based sizing logic: Risk = Weight * Volatility.
task: "Evaluate if the PM is correct about which position drives portfolio risk."
anchor_answers:
  strong:
    response: |
      The PM is mathematically incorrect. 
      Pharma Risk: 10% * 12% = 1.2 units of risk.
      Biotech Risk: 5% * 60% = 3.0 units of risk. 
      The Biotech position is 2.5x riskier than the Pharma position despite 
      having half the capital. The PM is suffering from notional bias.
  failing:
    response: |
      The PM is correct. The 10% allocation represents double the capital 
      commitment, meaning price movements in the Pharma stock will have 
      the largest absolute impact on the portfolio's NAV day-to-day.
