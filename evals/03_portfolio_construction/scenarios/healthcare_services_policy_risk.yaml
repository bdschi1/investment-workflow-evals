# === CONTEXT ===

context:
  company:
    name: "National Healthcare Services"
    ticker: "NHS"
    sector: "Healthcare Services"
    market_cap: "$15B"
    description: >
      Diversified healthcare services company with exposure to government
      reimbursement across Medicare Advantage, Medicaid managed care, and
      post-acute care services.

  risk_profile:
    trailing_beta: 0.65
    trailing_volatility: "16%"
    sector_classification: "Defensive Healthcare"
    factor_model_risk: "Low"
    earnings_stability: "High (10 consecutive beats)"

  policy_exposure:
    pending_rule_change: "CMS Medicare Advantage rate methodology revision"
    potential_impact: "-15% to -25% revenue at risk"
    timeline: "Final rule expected Q1 2025"
    historical_precedent: "2014 MA rate cuts caused 30%+ drawdowns in exposed names"
    probability_estimate: "40-60% chance of adverse outcome"

  market_conditions: >
    Healthcare services sector trading at premium multiples on defensive
    characteristics. Factor models showing low systematic risk. Sell-side
    consensus assumes benign regulatory outcome.

  portfolio_context:
    other_policy_exposed_names:
      - "Medicaid MCO (15% of portfolio)"
      - "Dialysis provider (8% of portfolio)"
      - "Home health company (5% of portfolio)"
    total_reimbursement_policy_exposure: "28% + this position"

# === TASK ===

task:
  prompt: >
    A healthcare services company shows low historical volatility but faces a
    potential reimbursement rule change with asymmetric downside. The stock
    appears low risk in factor models.

    Explain how this risk should be classified and reflected in position sizing.

    Your response should address:
    1. Why trailing volatility is an inadequate risk measure here
    2. How to classify policy risk (environmental vs idiosyncratic)
    3. How to incorporate forward-looking, non-linear risk into sizing
    4. Portfolio context considerations (correlated policy exposure)

  expected_output_type: "risk_assessment_framework"

  constraints:
    - "Must not rely on trailing volatility as primary risk signal"
    - "Must correctly classify policy risk"
    - "Must consider portfolio-level policy correlation"
    - "Must address asymmetric/non-linear loss potential"

      weight: 35
      criteria:
        - "Identifies policy risk as environmental, not idiosyncratic"
        - "Recognizes inadequacy of trailing volatility"
        - "Understands asymmetric payoff structure"
        - "Does not conflate low volatility with low risk"

    - name: "Forward-Looking Risk Estimation"
      id: "forward_risk"
      weight: 35
      criteria:
        - "Does not rely on trailing volatility"
        - "Incorporates scenario-based risk assessment"
        - "Considers historical precedent for policy events"
        - "Appropriately sizes for tail outcomes"

    - name: "Portfolio Context"
      id: "portfolio_context"
      weight: 30
      criteria:
        - "Considers correlated policy exposure across holdings"
        - "Recognizes aggregate reimbursement risk"
        - "Does not treat positions as independent"
        - "Evaluates portfolio-level policy concentration"

  critical_failures:
    - "Used historical volatility as primary risk signal"
    - "Treated policy risk as optional monitoring item"
    - "Ignored portfolio-level policy correlation"
    - "Confused stability with safety"

  pass_threshold: 70

# === PITFALLS ===

pitfalls:
  - description: "Relying on low beta as safety signal"
    failure_type: "backward_looking_risk"
    severity: "critical"

  - description: "Treating tail risk as catalyst to monitor rather than size for"
    failure_type: "tail_risk_dismissal"
    severity: "critical"

  - description: "Ignoring correlated policy exposure in portfolio"
    failure_type: "correlation_blindness"
    severity: "major"

  - description: "Assuming benign outcome because that's consensus"
    failure_type: "consensus_anchoring"
    severity: "major"

# === ADVERSARIAL VARIANT ===

adversarial_example:
  response: >
    Given the stock's low beta and stable earnings history, the position can
    be sized aggressively, with policy risk monitored as a potential catalyst.

  why_this_fails:
    - "Treats tail risk as optional"
    - "Confuses stability with safety"
    - "Ignores non-linear loss potential"
    - "Uses backward-looking risk as sizing input"
